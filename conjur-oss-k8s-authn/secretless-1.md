Applications and application developers should be **incapable of leaking secrets**.

To achieve that goal, you’ll play two roles in this tutorial:

1. A **Security Admin** who handles secrets, and has sole access to those secrets
2. An **Application Developer** with no access to secrets.

The situation looks like this:

Specifically, we will:

**As the security admin:**

Create a PostgreSQL database
Create a DB user for the application
Add that user’s credentials to Kubernetes Secrets
Configure Secretless to connect to PostgreSQL using those credentials

**As the application developer:**

Configure the application to connect to PostgreSQL via Secretless
Deploy the application and the Secretless sidecar
