### 1. Start Minikube

Minikube has been installed and configured in the environment. Check that it is properly installed, by running the minikube version command:

`minikube version`{{execute}}

Start the cluster, by running the minikube start command:

`minikube start`{{execute}}

Great! You now have a running Kubernetes cluster in your online terminal. Minikube started a virtual machine for you, and a Kubernetes cluster is now running in that VM.


### 2. Cluster Info
The cluster can be interacted with using the kubectl CLI. This is the main approach used for managing Kubernetes and the applications running on top of the cluster.

Details of the cluster and its health status can be discovered via `kubectl cluster-info`{{execute}}

To view the nodes in the cluster using `kubectl get nodes`{{execute}}

If the node is marked as *NotReady* then it is still starting the components.

This command shows all nodes that can be used to host our applications. Now we have only one node, and we can see that itâ€™s status is ready (it is ready to accept applications for deployment).

### 3. Dashboard 

Enable the dashboard using Minikube with the command minikube addons enable dashboard

Make the Kubernetes Dashboard available by deploying the following YAML definition. This should only be used on Katacoda.

kubectl apply -f /opt/kubernetes-dashboard.yaml

The Kubernetes dashboard allows you to view your applications in a UI. In this deployment, the dashboard has been made available on port 30000.

The URL to the dashboard is https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-30000-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/

It will take a moment to start the dashboard.   Let's move on the load the dashboard later.
