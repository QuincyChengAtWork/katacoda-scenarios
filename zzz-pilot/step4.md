Having defined the policy framework, we can load the specific data for the database.

Create the following file as “db.yml”:

Declare the secrets which are used to access the database
<pre class="file" data-filename="db.yml" data-target="replace">- &variables
  - !variable password
</pre>

Define a group which will be able to fetch the secrets
<pre class="file" data-filename="db.yml">
- !group secrets-users
</pre>

"read" privilege allows the client to read metadata.
"execute" privilege allows the client to read the secret data.
These are normally granted together, but they are distinct just like read and execute bits on a filesystem.

<pre class="file" data-filename="db.yml">
- !permit
  resource: *variables
  privileges: [ read, execute ]
  roles: !group secrets-users
</pre>


Note: You can create this file, either by clicking above "Copy to Editor" or executing `cp db1.bak db.yml`{{execute}}

Now load it using the following command:

```
docker cp ./db.yml root_client_1:db.yml
docker-compose exec client conjur policy load db db.yml
```{{execute}}

```
Loaded policy 'db'
{
  "created_roles": {
  },
  "version": 1
}
```

The variable `db/password` has been created, but it doesn’t contain any data. So the next step is to load the password value:

```
password=$(openssl rand -hex 12)
echo $password
```{{execute}}

`ac8932bccf835a5a13586100`

`docker-compose exec client conjur variable values add db/password $password`{{execute}}

`Value added`

`docker-compose exec client conjur variable value db/password`{{execute}}

`ac8932bccf835a5a13586100`
