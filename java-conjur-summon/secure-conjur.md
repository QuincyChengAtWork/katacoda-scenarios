We will following the [Conjur tutorial](https://www.conjur.org/get-started/quick-start/oss-environment/) to set up a Conjur OSS environment.   It is the first step of the offical quickstart tutorial.   If you want to know more it, please go to https://www.conjur.org/get-started/quick-start/oss-environment/


# Git clone the conjur-quickstart GitHub repository
```
git clone https://github.com/cyberark/conjur-quickstart.git
```{{execute}}

# Pull the docker image
```
docker-compose -f conjur-quickstart/docker-compose.yml pull
```{{execute}}

# Generate the master key
The master data key will be used later to encrypt the database.
In the working directory, generate the key and store it to a file:
* Tip: Although not mandatory, we prefer to store sensitive data to a file and not to display it directly on console screen.

```
docker-compose -f conjur-quickstart/docker-compose.yml run --no-deps --rm conjur data-key generate > data_key
```{{execute}}


The data key is generated in the working directory and is stored in a file called data_key.

When the key is generated, the terminal returns the following:
```
Creating network "conjur-quickstart_default" with the default driver
```

# Load master key as an environment variable
Load data_key file content (the master data key) as an environment variable:

```
export CONJUR_DATA_KEY="$(< data_key)"
```{{execute}}

# Start the Conjur OSS environment

```
docker-compose up -d
```{{execute}}

When Conjur OSS starts, the terminal returns the following:
```
Creating postgres_database ... done
Creating bot_app ... done
Creating openssl ... done
Creating conjur_server ... done
Creating nginx_proxy ... done
Creating conjur_client ... done
```

Verification
Run the following command to see a list of running containers:

`docker ps -a`{{execute}}


# Create admin account
Create a Conjur account and initialize the built-in admin user.

```
docker-compose exec conjur conjurctl account create myConjurAccount > admin_data
```{{execute}}
An account named `myConjurAccount` is created and the admin user is initialized, following keys are created and stored at `admin_data` file:

- admin user API key. Later on, we will use this key to log in to Conjur.
- myConjurAccount Conjur account public key.


# Connect the Conjur client to the Conjur server
This is a one-time action. For the duration of the containerâ€™s life or until additional initcommand is issued, the Conjur client and the Conjur server remain connected.
Use the account name that you created in step 5:

```
docker-compose exec client conjur init -u conjur -a myConjurAccount
```
Verification
The terminal returns the following output:

`Wrote configuration to /root/.conjurrc`
