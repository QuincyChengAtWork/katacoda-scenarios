This pattern can be extended in the following ways:

- Add more variables to the `db` policy
- Add more hosts to the `frontend` policy
- Automatically enroll hosts into the `frontend` layer by adding a Host Factory.
- Add more applications that need access to the database password, and grant them access by adding entitlements to the `db` policy.
- Create user groups such as `database-administrators` and `frontend-developers`, and give them management rights on their respective policies. In this way, policy management can be federated and scaled.
